      The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to
      the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed
      primarily for hunting hare (beagling). With a great sense of smell and
      superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for
      prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the
      world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet
      due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.
