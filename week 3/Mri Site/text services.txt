            <li>Brain injury from trauma</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>MRI of the heart and blood vessels</h3>
        <p>MRI that focuses on the heart or blood vessels can assess:
        </p>

            <li>Size and function of the heart's chambers</li>
            <li> Thickness and movement of the walls of the heart</li>

            <li>Structural problems in the aorta, such as aneurysms or dissections</li>
            <li>Inflammation or blockages in the blood vessels</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>MRI of other internal organs</h3>

            <li>Prostate</li>

        </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>MRI of bones and joints</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Joint abnormalities caused by traumatic or repetitive injuries, such as torn cartilage or ligaments
            </li>
            <li> Disk abnormalities in the spine</li>
            <li>Bone infections</li>
            <li>Tumors of the bones and soft tissues</li>

        </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>MRI of the breasts</h3>
        <p>MRI can be used with mammography to detect breast cancer, particularly in women who have dense breast
            tissue or
            who might be at high risk of the disease</p>
